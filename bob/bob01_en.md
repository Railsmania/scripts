#Project bob adding bootstrap theme
Today, we're going to create a new Rails application and deploy it to a public internet address. We believe in deploy early, deploy often, so we're going to automate the deployment process as much as possible using a Ruby gem called Capistrano.

So, let's get started!

First, let's open up a command line window to create our Rails project. We're going to name our project bee ohh bee "bob". We can create our project by running the ```rails new bob``` command in the directory where we want our project to be created.

Rails new takes a few moments to generate all the base files for your project. Once it's compelete, let's verify everything is ok by starting a development rails http server on localhost.

From the command line run "rails server". Now open a new browser tab and go to [insert URL and port here].

We can see the landing page that Rails generated for us. It displays information about the environment that our application is currently running in. Everything is working fine if we can see this landing page.

Now, time to deploy our application to a publicly accessible internet address.

We'll need the capistrano gem for deployment, a rake gem, capistrano3-unicorn, capistrano-rvm, and this capistrano-copy gem. Edit the Gemfile to add these, then save that file.

Next, we need to run bundle install on the command line to install those new gems into the project.

Now it's time to create our capistrano deployment script. First we need to run capistrano install from the command line. That will auto generate a lot of useful files for us.

Next, open the autogenerated Capfile and uncomment this line about requiring capistrano bundler and capistrano/rvm. Save that file. Now open the config/deploy.rb file and change the scm git to scm copy and uncomment that line.

Now we need to edit config/deploy/production.rb so that capistrano knows exactly where to deploy our project to. Let's set our roles with the role command. Add a path to our SSH key, and this line about our server.

Finally, we're ready to try deploying our application. So, go into the console and type "cap production deploy" and if everything is configured correctly, you're app will make its way to your production server.

That's it for this video. We started with nothing and in just a few moments we had a basic Rails application ready deployed to our public server.
