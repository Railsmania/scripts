# The development environment

Hi!
In this video I’m going to explain very quickly how to work with our
online development environment.

The development environment has just the functionality needed to help
you develop your applications without becoming overly complicated.

On the left we have the files view. We can click on directories to
expand them and in the files to open them.
If you right-click on a directory you can see  an option to add files or
add directories. If we click on this option we see you can select files
on your local machine to upload, we select one and click ok, we will
upload the file to our development environment.
We provide you with plenty of space to host all the files you will need
for typical rails applications.

The main part of the window is used by the editor view, simple editor
with syntax highlighting for Ruby.
We can modify any file and you will see this mark (show the mark)
indicating it is not saved. Select file saver or press Crl +s ,
Command+s on Mac to save the file. The file will be saved on the cloud
and you can access to it from any device.

The last important component is the terminal view. Our development
environment gives you access to a Linux Debian system with full
privileges. You have access to all the commands you may need. In
particular in the lessons we will use often rails commands, for instance
we can execute rails new (rails new new_project). You can see how the
file view automatically updated its contents. Now we can move to this
new directory (cd new_project) and list the files (ls).


That’s it for this video. We hope you find this development environment
both simple and useful.
