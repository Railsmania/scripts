By now you already know about generators and how to find and use them to create controllers in your application. In this segment we're going to cover a much more interesting and advanced generator called scaffold.

A scaffold generator in Rails provides a full set of classes needed to make a database-backed, resourceful web application. A model, database migration for that model, controller to manipulate it, views to display and manipulate the data, and a test suite for each resource can be automatically generated by scaffold.

# How to Generate Scaffolding

To demonstrate, let's set up a simple resource called "HighScore" that will keep track of our highest score on video games we play.
```
bundle exec rails generate scaffold HighScore game:string score:integer
```
In this command we tell scaffold that we want our application to have a resource called "HighScore" and that it should have a property "game" that is string and another property "score" which is an integer.

The scaffold generator checks that all the directories for models, controllers, helpers, layouts, functional and unit tests exist as expected.

It then creates the views, controller, model and database migrations for HighScore (the migration file will create the high_scores table and fields in our database). The scaffold generator also takes care of the resourceful routes for our "HighScore" resource, and even creates unit test placeholders for everything.

Because we have a new migration, our next step is to simply run our migrations, we can do that with the command:
```
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
We explain more about database migrations in another series, but for now you should just know that this command will run the Rails code living in the 20130717151933_create_high_scores.rb file in order to modify the schema of our database. 

# It's Alive!

So now it's time to see the application that the Rails scaffold generator created for us.
```
bundle exec rails server
```

Go to your browser and open the server url with the path /high_scores. All this html and functionality you are seeing was automatically generated. This is all functional for your typical CRUD requests, so we can already create new high scores (55,160 on Space Invaders!)

We have only used two generators in this lessons but rails has other generators. Execute:
```
bundle exec rails generate
```
To get a list of all the generators in your project. Aside from the standard set provided by rails, other gems can install their own generators in your project - so don't be surprised to see generators in your project that are not shown in this video.

# Destroy Scaffolding

Well, that's it for this review of the scaffold generator in Rails. But before going, I wanted to point out that the "rails destroy" command also works when you need to remove scaffolding. In this example, all we'd need to do is run 

```
bundle exec rails destroy scaffold HighScore
```

And as you can see, Rails has kindly deleted all the generated files and code. Easy breezy.
