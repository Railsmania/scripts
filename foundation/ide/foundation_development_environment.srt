Hi! In this video, I'm going to explain very quickly how to work

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with our online development environment. The development environment has

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
just the right amount of functionality needed to help you develop your applications

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
without being overly complicated.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
On the left we have the files view. Every account comes with a workspace directory.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can click on that directory to expand it. To open a file, simply

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
click on it once.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you right click on a directory, you can see an option to add files or to add directories.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Choosing either of these options will allow you to select files from your local machine to upload.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You can select one or more files and click ok, and it will upload them

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to your workspace.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In our development environment, you'll have plenty of space to host all the files you need for a

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
typical Rails application.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The main part of the window, on the right side, is used by the editor view.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's an easy to use, simple code editor with syntax highlighting for Ruby.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When we modify any file, you will see this mark.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Indicating that the file is not yet saved.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To save the file, select [ Editor - Save ] from the menu bar.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Or use the standard shortcut keys to save, such as Ctrl+S on Windows or

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cmd+S on Mac.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The file will be saved in our cloud environment and will be accessible from any of your devices.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The last important component is the terminal view.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Our development environment gives you access to a Linux Debian environment

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
with full privileges. You have access to all the commands you may need.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In the lesson we will often use the "Rails" commands in the terminal, for instance:

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we can execute Rails new such as "rails new new_project"

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and you can see how the files view automatically updated its contents

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
with the new project that Rails created.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now we can move to this new directory using standard *Nix

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
commands like "cd new_project" and list the

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
files with "ls"

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,333
So that's it for this video, we hope you find this development environment both simple and useful.
