# The development environment

Hi!
In this video I’m going to explain very quickly how to work with our
online development environment.

The development environment has just the right amount of functionality needed 
to help you develop your applications without being overly complicated.

On the left we have the files view. Every account comes with a workspace directory.
We can click on that directory to expand it. To open a file, simply click on it once.

If you right-click on a directory you can see an option to add files or
to add directories. Choosing either of these options will allow you to select files
from your local machine to upload. You can select one or more files and click ok, and
it will upload them to your workspace.

In our development environment, you'll have plenty of space to host all the files you need
for a typical rails applications.

The main part of the window, on the right side, is used by the editor view. It's an easy to use,
simple code editor with syntax highlighting for Ruby.

When we modify any file you will see this mark (show the mark)

indicating it is not yet saved. 

To save the file, select Editor -> Save from the menu bar, or use the standard shortcut keys to save, such as - control+s on windows
and command+s on mac. The file will be saved in our cloud environment and will be accessible from any of your devices.

The last important component is the terminal view. Our development
environment gives you access to a Linux Debian system with full
privileges. You have access to all the commands you may need. 

In the lessons we will often use the rails commands in the terminal. For instance
we can execute rails new (rails new new_project). You can see how the
file view automatically updated its contents with the new project that rails created.

Now we can move to this
new directory by using standard nix commands like (cd new_project) and list the files with (ls). 


So that’s it for this video. We hope you find this development environment
both simple and useful.
