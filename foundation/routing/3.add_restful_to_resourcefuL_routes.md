# Adding RESTful Routes to Resources
Occasionally you might want to add another route to another action in your controller that isn't provided to you by default with resourceful routes. And that's not a problem with Rails, because you are not limited to the seven routes that RESTful routing creates by default. If you like, you may add additional routes that apply to the collection or individual members of the collection.

## What are collections? What are members?


## Adding Member Routes
To add a member route, just add a member block into the resource block:

resources :photos do
  member do
    get 'preview'
  end
end

This will recognize /photos/1/preview with GET, and route to the preview action of PhotosController, with the resource id value passed in params[:id]. It will also create the preview_photo_url and preview_photo_path helpers.

Within the block of member routes, each route name specifies the HTTP verb will be recognized. You can use get, patch, put, post, or delete here . If you don't have multiple member routes, you can also pass :on to a route, eliminating the block:

resources :photos do
  get 'preview', on: :member
end
You can leave out the :on option, this will create the same member route except that the resource id value will be available in params[:photo_id] instead of params[:id].

## Adding Collection Routes

To add a route to the collection:

resources :photos do
  collection do
    get 'search'
  end
end
This will enable Rails to recognize paths such as /photos/search with GET, and route to the search action of PhotosController. It will also create the search_photos_url and search_photos_path route helpers.

Just as with member routes, you can pass :on to a route:

resources :photos do
  get 'search', on: :collection
end


## Adding Routes on top of Existing Actions

To add an alternate new action using the :on shortcut:

resources :comments do
  get 'preview', on: :new
end
This will enable Rails to recognize paths such as /comments/new/preview with GET, and route to the preview action of CommentsController. It will also create the preview_new_comment_url and preview_new_comment_path route helpers.

If you find yourself adding many extra actions to a resourceful route, it's time to stop and ask yourself whether you're disguising the presence of another resource.
